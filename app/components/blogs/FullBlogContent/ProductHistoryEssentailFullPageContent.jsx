<h2 dir="ltr"><span>1. Introduction</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Imagine walking into a physical store, picking up an item you like, setting it down, and wandering off, only to forget where you found it. This happens every day in online shopping.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Enter the "Recently Viewed Products" feature—the digital equivalent of a helpful store assistant who points you back to the items you've shown interest in.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It might be small, but it certainly does make an essential difference when one customer is lost to another: loyal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Read more about it below to discover why Shopify features like that can be valuable and how best you can leverage the "Recently Viewed Products" feature toward your sales goal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your shopping BFF – always remembering what you loved.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>_________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>2. What is this "Recently Viewed Products" Feature?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"Recently Viewed Products" displays items a customer has browsed during their session. It usually appears as a carousel, sidebar, or section on the site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It provides easy access to those products without forcing customers to navigate multiple pages or use the search bar.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your breadcrumb trail to shopping success!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>_________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>3. Why "Recently Viewed Products" are a Must-have?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many Shopify store owners wonder whether they need “Recently Viewed Products” in their accounts. Are you also one of them?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If yes, here are some solid reasons that make this feature a must-have in your Shopify store.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Improve User Convenience</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>E-commerce is fundamentally about making a shopping experience easier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This user interface simplifies navigation by putting products customers looked at before and liked directly back in front of them, decreasing frustration.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Help Tackle Cart Abandonment</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The main reason users abandon carts these days is distraction. Instead of leaving their site, these customers will remain on your site if accessing items they already liked is the easiest way out.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Encourage Impulse Shopping</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When combined with compelling graphics and placement, this functionality encourages impulse buys because it keeps great products top-of-mind.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Building Brand Loyalty</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Customers are more likely to return to your site and shop again if they know your site is easy to navigate and remember their preferences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We’re all about those ‘Oops, I need that!’ moments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>4. How Does It Affect Your Sales?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The “Recently Viewed Products” feature can drastically boost your online presence, enhance buyer engagement, and multiply returns. Stay tuned as we throw light on how this feature improves your sales:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Customers returning to the same products are likely to add more items to their cart, thus increasing the overall value of the purchase.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Facilitating Retargeting Campaigns</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This feature allows for collecting data to support retargeting, for instance, through abandoned cart emails or dynamic ads featuring the products they have looked at but haven't bought.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Higher Retention of Customers</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It keeps them returning with an enjoyable shopping experience as long as they can rely on the store to remember their preferences.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>_________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>5. Step-by-Step How-To of Adding the Feature</span></h2>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Etsy puts up recently viewed items on the home page for return visitors so they can pick up from where they left off.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your browsing history, but make it stylish!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>_____________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="hide-underline index-main-sub-heading"><span>9. Using "Recently Viewed Products" to Drive Personalized Marketing </span> </a></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The future of e-commerce will undoubtedly be more customized marketing. One feature of it is "Recently Viewed Products."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use these insights from a customer's browsing history to deliver more targeted and highly effective campaigns resonating with each user's unique preference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Here is how to seize the opportunity of that:</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Use Browsing Data for Insight</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The "Recently Viewed Products" section is a treasure trove for customers and your marketing team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Tracking the products customers view can reflect their interests, price sensitivity, and even what products they prefer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The data can, therefore, be used to tailor messages to meet that specific need.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Design Dynamic Retargeting Campaigns</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Dynamic retargeting ads are one of the best ways to take advantage of "Recently Viewed Products fully."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On platforms like Facebook and Google, you can easily place ads on the products your customers have looked at but did not buy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gentle reminders that this does help boost conversion rates, sometimes dramatically so.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Email Hyper-Personalization</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Email marketing is the most potent weapon in your arsenal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use the "Recently Viewed Products" feature to create emails personally targeted for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Just send out the email containing recently viewed products and some complementary offers or deals.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A subject line like "Still thinking about these?" can prompt interest, while adding the recently viewed items makes it easy for customers to return to their favorites.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Use It for Cross-Selling and Upselling</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Integrate the browsing data with related products to create cross-selling opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For example, if a customer viewed a pair of running shoes, you could recommend socks, water bottles, or fitness trackers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Upsell strategies may include showing premium versions of the viewed product or highlighting limited-time offers on bundles.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Make It Automated and Seamless</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Automation tools like </span><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/klaviyo-email-marketing"><span>Klaviyo </span></a><span>or </span><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/hubspot-2"><span>HubSpot </span></a><span>can integrate with your Shopify store to streamline this process.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These platforms can automatically send emails or trigger retargeting ads based on a customer's interactions with your site.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By strategically integrating the "Recently Viewed Products" feature with your personalized marketing efforts, you can create a shopping experience uniquely tailored to each customer, increasing engagement and sales.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Keeping your faves just a click away!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a class="hide-underline index-main-sub-heading"><span>10. Mistakes to Avoid with "Recently Viewed Products" </span></a></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While there are various advantages offered by "Recently Viewed Products," its lack of proper execution may degrade the experience. Some of the most common mistakes that people should avoid:</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Presenting customers with too much Stuff</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One of the biggest mistakes is showing too many recently viewed products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Although variety is essential, showing too many can clutter the page and confuse customers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Stick to a manageable number; five to seven products are usually ideal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When showing items, prioritize the ones with the highest engagement or most relevant to the customer's browsing journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This way, the section remains helpful rather than overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Wrong Placement of the Section</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Placement is key to the success of "Recently Viewed Products."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Tucked at the bottom of a page or hidden in an obscure tab, it will never see the light of day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Placement is strategic for maximum visibility and interaction on the product page, homepage, or cart page.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Not Optimizing for Mobile</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With more shoppers browsing on mobile devices than ever, not optimizing this feature for smaller screens is a critical mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This section should be fully responsive and clean in design, with easy navigation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The designs should adapt nicely to different screen sizes, like on a desktop.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Failure to Update or Refresh Content</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Static and old "Recently Viewed Products" banners become irrelevant over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Refresh the feature often to reflect the customer's most recent interactions accurately.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Real-time data integration would be a good idea to ensure the countenance remains engaging and dynamic in the display.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Not Enough Personalization</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A generic "Recently Viewed Products" section misses an opportunity to make a more significant impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Personalization can boost this feature by adding related products, best sellers in the same category, or products often purchased together.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This would improve shopping experiences and enhance upselling and cross-selling opportunities.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Failure to Analyze Performance</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many stores implement the "Recently Viewed Products" feature without tracking its performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Without data, it's impossible to know whether the feature drives conversions or occupies space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use analytics tools to monitor click-through rates, engagement time, and conversions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can ensure that the "Recently Viewed Products" feature remains valuable for improving customer experience and driving sales.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Because great products deserve a spotlight encore!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>___________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"> <a class="hide-underline index-main-sub-heading"><span>9. Conclusion</span> </a></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In other words, adding the "Recently Viewed Products" to your Shopify store is about making shopping smooth and personalized, leading to increased conversions and loyalty.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With the well-placed implementation and optimization of the feature, you will achieve excellent customer satisfaction and promote sales simultaneously.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Shop smarter, not harder – we’ve got your back!</span></p>
